# food-journal-app
this is my first mobile app made by react native
in this app you input every meal you eat during the day by the inputs of food naame, food amount and approximated calories. and this will calculate how many calories you've done so far in the day and will tell you if you're doing great or good or bad! you can clear the record by the said button as well. of course new and better and smarter features will be added this is just the first version of this app made in 2 days.

I've also used basic react hooks useState and useEffect in this project and also managed props drilling. so if you're interested you can see that here 
this app is going to be updated and be adding features during time in newer branches. Stay tuned for that!

download the code to see the source and to see the live deployment of the app:
1- download the code and run " expo start" or "npm start" in the direcory's command line
2- make sure to install the expo go app on your device 
3- finally you can scan the qr code given in the terminal and you can see the live deployment of the mobile app
